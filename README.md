6. Does Hoisting work with all the variables and why??
7. What is the precedence in event loop? between Promise() and setTimeOut()??
8. Reduce and Map diff ??
9. where do you mostly use Rest Operator ??
10. what are the ES6 Features you have used??
11. What is Flex-Box ? in CSS
12. currying in js

## Coding Problems

1. //Input- const data = [-6, 8, -3, 2, 14, -17, 8];

  //output- [-6,-3,-17,8,2,14,8] (sequnce of numbers should be same).


2. //Input = [3,1, 33,0,5,12,77];

  // Print Largest number, second Largest , Third Largest


3  //Input- [ "hot Drinks", "cOld drinks","Hot Drinks","Tea", "teA" ];

   //Output - should be unique key and Capitalize letter ["Hot Drinks", "Cold Drinks","Tea"]


4.  //Input -  [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2, 5, 3, 3, 4, 8];
    // Output- Show Frequnecy of duplicate elements Only -


5.   // Input- [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2, 5, 3, 3, 4, 8];
    
     //Output- Frequnecy of each elements

6.  //Input- "Praveen"

   //Output - Frequency of each charcaters

7 // Input- [1,3,55, 66, 77]; searchElement = 99 using binary search algo

   //output- 99 not exist in array

8. //Input - abab (we have to pick two diffent charcter and replace with third one like- ab can be replace with c so now string will be "cab" again we can replace "ca" into "b" so it will be "bb"
   // if the charcters is same so the freency of charcter will be output)

     //output- 2 Because ("bb") frequency is 2

9. //Input- [5, 2, 6, 1, 3, 9, 0] sum = 9

   //output - find the index of those elements whose sum is equal to 9 like - 6+ 3= 9 so the index of 6 and 3 is [4,2] output as same in all array pairs index

   // can try - Find elemnts whose sum equal to given sum like [6,3]

10.  //Input - [3, 4, 1, 4, 1];

    //Output- [4,1] return duplicate elements array only
    

11. //HARD  //Input - "2[ab]c3[xyz]";
    
    //Output- 2ababc3xyzxyzxyz
    // when [ comes means repeat inside all string with outside number like 2 [ab] = 2times "ab" so 2abab same like that



12 //Input -  [1, 3, 9, 11];

  // Output- [5,7] missing elemnts in odd series


13. //Input - [1, 2, 3, [4, [5]],[6],[[7]]];
    
   //output- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] without js function Flat

14. //Input-  "abcd"

   //Output - a-Bb-Ccc-Dddd (Captal and frequency with postion in string number)
   
 15. Find the next palindrome number. If I pass any integer value to function it should return the next palindrome number.
      For example:
      If I pass 105 - it should return 111
      If I pass 100 - it should return 101
      
 16. Print the first “n” prime numbers. N is anything a user might enter.
      For example:
      n = 5 Output is 2,3,5,7,11
      n = 8 Output is 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19
      
  17. Write a function fib() that takes an integer n and returns the series up to nth Fibonacci number.
	
        For example: 

      fib(1);  // => 1
      fib(2);  // => 1, 1
      fib(3);  // => 1, 1, 2
      fib(4);  // => 1, 1, 2, 3
      fib(5);  // => 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
      fib(6);  // => 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
